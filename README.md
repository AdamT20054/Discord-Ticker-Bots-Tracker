# Discord-Ticker-Bots-Tracker
A bot to keep track of where the bots are and other useful things for diagnosing problems and stopping API abuse.


note:

you need to do
`npm install discord.js`

each client has its own token, the token goes into .env
to load that token, go the the bottom and change:

clientX.login(process.env.X);

X is the client number and token
